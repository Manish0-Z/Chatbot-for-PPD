# Instructions for setting up your .env file

1. Create a file named ".env" in the root directory of your project
2. Copy and paste the following content into the file:

PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=your_very_secure_secret_key_for_jwt_tokens
MONGO_USER=manishbaral
MONGO_PASS=1dIc0odKBV7ab3vX
MONGO_CLUSTER=cluster0.0hwxpms.mongodb.net

3. Save the file and restart your server

This will provide the necessary environment variables for your application to work properly.
The JWT_SECRET is required for user authentication to function correctly.
