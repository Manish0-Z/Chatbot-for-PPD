// Paragraph format responses for explanation-type questions
const paragraphResponses = {
    postpartumDepression: {
        what: "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious mood disorder that affects approximately 1 in 7 women after childbirth. It goes beyond the normal 'baby blues' and involves persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that can interfere with daily functioning. PPD is caused by a combination of physical, emotional, and hormonal changes, along with the stress and sleep deprivation that accompany caring for a newborn. It is a medical condition requiring proper treatment, not a character flaw or weakness.",
        why: "Postpartum depression develops due to multiple interrelated factors. The dramatic hormonal changes after delivery (rapid drops in estrogen and progesterone) affect brain chemistry and mood regulation. This biological shift combines with the physical exhaustion of recovery and sleep deprivation. Additionally, the psychological adjustment to parenthood, including identity changes, new responsibilities, and potential birth trauma, creates emotional vulnerability. Women with previous depression, limited support systems, or pregnancy complications face higher risks. These biological and psychosocial factors together create the conditions for postpartum depression to develop.",
        treatment: "Treatment for postpartum depression typically involves a combination of approaches tailored to each woman's needs. Psychotherapy (particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy) helps mothers develop coping strategies and process difficult emotions. Antidepressant medications may be prescribed, with certain options being safe during breastfeeding. Support groups connect mothers with others experiencing similar challenges, reducing isolation. Self-care measures like sleep prioritization, physical activity, and nutrition are essential components. For severe cases, more intensive treatments may be needed. Early intervention leads to better outcomes, so seeking help promptly is crucial."
    },
    breastfeeding: {
        why: "Breastfeeding provides numerous benefits for both babies and mothers. For babies, breast milk contains the perfect balance of nutrients, antibodies, and growth factors that strengthen the immune system, promote healthy weight, and reduce the risk of many conditions including infections, allergies, asthma, SIDS, and certain chronic diseases. For mothers, breastfeeding promotes faster recovery from childbirth, helps the uterus return to pre-pregnancy size, reduces the risk of breast and ovarian cancers, and creates opportunities for bonding. It also releases hormones that promote relaxation and attachment between mother and baby.",
        how: "Successful breastfeeding begins with proper positioning and latch. Hold your baby skin-to-skin, with their belly facing yours and their head aligned with your breast. Wait for your baby to open wide, then bring them quickly to your breast, aiming their lower lip well below your nipple. Their mouth should cover a large portion of the areola, not just the nipple. You'll know the latch is good when you see rounded cheeks, hear swallowing, and feel gentle tugging without pain. Feed on demand (typically 8-12 times daily), switching sides each session. Seek help from a lactation consultant if you experience pain or difficulties."
    },
    babycare: {
        sleep: "Newborn sleep is characterized by short cycles and frequent waking, typically totaling 14-17 hours daily in 2-3 hour segments. This pattern reflects their small stomachs needing frequent feeding and their developing nervous systems. Most babies don't develop mature sleep patterns until 3-6 months. To promote healthy sleep, establish consistent bedtime routines with dimmed lights, gentle activities, and minimal stimulation. Always place babies on their backs on firm, flat surfaces without blankets or toys to reduce SIDS risk. Room-sharing (but not bed-sharing) for the first 6-12 months is recommended for safety while facilitating easier feeding and monitoring.",
        crying: "Crying is a baby's primary communication method, signaling various needs including hunger, discomfort, overstimulation, or desire for connection. Newborns typically cry 2-3 hours daily, peaking around 6-8 weeks before gradually decreasing. When your baby cries, systematically check for hunger, dirty diaper, temperature discomfort, or desire to be held. Many babies respond well to the 5 S's: swaddling, side/stomach position (while awake), shushing, swinging, and sucking. If crying is excessive (more than 3 hours daily for more than 3 days weekly) or sounds unusual, consult your pediatrician to rule out medical causes like colic or reflux."
